# SuperDuper Project

A comprehensive learning journey combining Python programming fundamentals, SQL database operations, and data visualization. This project serves as a hands-on tutorial for developers learning to integrate multiple technologies including Python, SQL, data analysis, and web frameworks.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate:
- Python programming fundamentals (strings, integers, functions, conditionals)
- SQL database operations and queries
- Data visualization with matplotlib and pandas
- Integration of multiple tools in a cohesive project
- Best practices for project organization and documentation

## 📚 Learning Path

The project follows a structured learning approach:

1. **Python Fundamentals** - Basic concepts and syntax
2. **SQL Basics** - Database queries and data manipulation
3. **Data Integration** - Combining Python and SQL
4. **Data Visualization** - Creating charts and graphs
5. **Project Organization** - Professional development practices

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/esmahoney/SuperDuper
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Open the main notebook:**
   - Navigate to `SuperDuper.ipynb` in your browser
   - Start exploring the learning modules!

## 📊 Sample Database

The project includes a SQLite database (`data/cyberchase.db`) containing information about Cyberchase TV episodes with the following schema:

- `id` - Unique identifier for each episode
- `season` - Season number
- `episode_in_season` - Episode number within the season
- `title` - Episode title
- `topic` - Educational topic covered
- `air_date` - Original air date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `production_code` - PBS internal production ID

## 🎓 Learning Modules

### Python Fundamentals
- String manipulation and formatting
- Integer operations and calculations
- Function definitions and parameters
- Conditional statements and logic
- Boolean expressions and comparisons

### SQL Operations
- Basic SELECT queries
- Data filtering and sorting
- Aggregations and grouping
- Database connections from Python

### Data Visualization
- Bar charts with matplotlib
- Data processing with pandas
- Statistical analysis and insights

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with the main `SuperDuper.ipynb` notebook
2. Follow the step-by-step learning modules
3. Experiment with the provided code examples
4. Try modifying queries and visualizations
5. Build your own analysis using the sample data
